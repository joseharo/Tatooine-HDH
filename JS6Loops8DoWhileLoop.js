/* 1. Weâ€™d like a program to simulate part of the cake-baking process. Depending on the recipe, a different number of cups of sugar is required. Create the variable cupsOfSugarNeeded, and assign it a number value of your choosing. The cups of sugar must be added to the batter one at a time. Declare the variable cupsAdded and assign it the value 0.

2. We have a sweet tooth, so we want to add at least one cup of sugar to the batter even if the value of cupsOfSugarNeeded is 0. Create a do...while loop which increments cupsAdded by one while cupsAdded is less than cupsOfSugarNeeded. */
