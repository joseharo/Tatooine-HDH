/* Practice Good Scoping - Buenas practicas de alcance

Given the challenges with global variables and scope pollution, we should follow best practices for scoping our variables as tightly as possible using block scope.

Previniendo la contaminacion de alcance por variables globales, 

Tightly scoping your variables will greatly improve your code in several ways:

It will make your code more legible since the blocks will organize your code into discrete sections.
It makes your code more understandable since it clarifies which variables are associated with different parts of the program rather than having to keep track of them line after line!
Itâ€™s easier to maintain your code, since your code will be modular.
It will save memory in your code because it will cease to exist after the block finishes running.
