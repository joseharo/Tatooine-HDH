/* Iterator Documentation 

1. In the code editor, there is an array called words. We want to create a new array of interesting words. The first thing we want to do is check if there are words that are fewer than 6 characters long. There is something missing in the words.some() method call. Fix this method so that true is printed to the console.


The .some() method returned true, which means there are some words in the array that are shorter than six characters. Use the .filter() method to save any words longer than 5 characters to a new variable called interestingWords, declared with const.

In the last line of main.js, there is this code:

// console.log(interestingWords.every(word =>        ));

Complete the code between the parentheses to check if every element has more than 5 characters.

Make sure to uncomment (delete the // before) the last line of the program before you run the code.
*/

const words = ['unique', 'uncanny', 'pique', 'oxymoron', 'guise'];

// Something is missing in the method call below

console.log(words.some(word => {
  return word.length < 6;
}));

// Use filter to create a new array
const interestingWords = words.filter((word) => {return word.length > 5});


// Make sure to uncomment the code below and fix the incorrect code before running it

console.log(interestingWords.every((word) => {return word.length > 5}));
