/* The Increment and Decrement Operator 

Other mathematical assignment operators include the increment operator (++) and decrement operator (--).

The increment operator will increase the value of the variable by 1. The decrement operator will decrease the value of the variable by 1. For example: */

let a = 10;
a++;
console.log(a); // Output: 11
let b = 20;
b--;
console.log(b); // Output: 19

/* Just like the previous mathematical assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=), the variableâ€™s value is updated and assigned as the new value of that variable */

// Excercises

// Using the increment operator, increase the value of gainedDollar.

let gainedDollar = 3;
gainedDollar++; // Can be writted as gainedDollar = gainedDollar + 1;
console.log(gainedDollar); // Output: 4

let lostDollar = 50;
lostDollar--; // Can be writted as lostDollar = lostDollar - 1;
console.log(lostDollar); // Output: 49
