/* Create an Array */
/* One way we can create an array is to use an array literal. An array literal creates an array by wrapping items in square brackets []. Remember from the previous exercise, arrays can store any data type â€” we can have an array that holds all the same data types or an array that holds different data types. */

['element example', 10, true]

/* Individual array elements:
element example
10
true

Square brackets
[]                           

Let's take a closer look at the syntax in the array example:

1. The array is represented by the square brackets [] and the content indise.

2. Each content item inside an array is called an elemento.

3. There are three differen elements inside the array.

4. Each element inside the array is a different data type.

We can also save an array to a variable. You may have noticed we did this in the previous excercise:     */

/* Instructions:
1. Declare a variable using const named hobbies and set it equal to an array with three strings inside of it.

2. Use console.log() to print hobbies to the console.                     */

const hobbies = ['music', 'tv', 'books'];
console.log(hobbies);
