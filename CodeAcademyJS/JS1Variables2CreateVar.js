/* 
Let’s consider the example above:

1. var, short for variable, is a JavaScript keyword that creates, or declares, a new variable.

2. myName is the variable’s name. Capitalizing in this way is a standard convention in JavaScript called camel casing. In camel casing you group words into one, the first word is lowercase, then every word that follows will have its first letter uppercased. (e.g. camelCaseEverything).

3. = is the assignment operator. It assigns the value ('Arya') to the variable (myName).

4. 'Arya' is the value assigned (=) to the variable myName. You can also say that the myName variable is initialized with a value of 'Arya'.

5. After the variable is declared, the string value 'Arya' is printed to the console by referencing the variable name: console.log(myName).

var favoriteFood = 'pizza';

// Declare a variable named favoriteFood using the var keyword and assign to it the string 'pizza'.

var numOfSlices = 8;
// Declare a variable named numOfSlices using the var keyword and assign to it the number 8.

console.log(favoriteFood);
// Under the numOfSlices variable, use console.log() to print the value saved to favoriteFood.

console.log(numOfSlices);
// On the following line, use console.log() to print the value saved to numOfSlices.
