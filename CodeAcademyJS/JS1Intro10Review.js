/* 
Let's take one more glance at the concepts we just learned:

Data is printed or logged to the console a panel that displays messages with:

console.log()

We can write single-line comments with //
Multi-line comments between /* and */

/*
There are 7 fundamental data types in JS: strings, booleans, numbers, null, undefined, symbol, and object.

Numbers are any number without quotes:
27.7798

Strings are characters wrapped in sigle or double quotes:
'Sample String'

The built-in arithmetic operators include:
+, -, *, /, and %

Objects including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The propierties are denoted with a . after the name of the object, example:
'Hello'.lenght.

Objects including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. Example:
'hello'.toUpperCase()

We can access prperties and methods by using the ., dot operator.

Built-in objects, including Math, are collections of methods and properties that JS provides.
